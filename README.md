# Welcome to SC1015-project repository
## About
Our mini-project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) focuses on dark chocolate bar ratings from [Flavors of Cacao's database](http://flavorsofcacao.com/chocolate_database.html). Our dataset was acquired from a previously scraped and cleaned dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soroushghaderi/chocolate-bar-2020?select=chocolate.csv)

## Problem Definition
- Can we find out what makes a dark chocolate product highly rated by experts?
## Techniques Used
- SMOTE() and its variations
- KFold cross validation
- Decision Tree, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
- One-hot encoding
## Outcome
- We discovered some variables that could influence the rating of a chocolate bar, such as number of ingredients, the taste of it.
- However, the variables in the dataset was not sufficient to predict the rating of a chocolate bar perfectly, but had somewhat acceptable accuracy, and was able to point out a large number of highly rated chocolate bars, despite a roughly 0.30 false positive rate.
- A more detailed dataset with more variables are recommended, such as the percentages of the ingredients, as well as a cleaner taste dataset.
